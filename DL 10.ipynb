Additionally, if you are working in a microservices architecture with services written in different languages, gRPC can provide a unified communication protocol across your services. However, if you are working with simple request/response APIs or need to support a wide range of clients, REST APIs may be a better choice."

This technique involves training a model to be resilient to the loss of precision that occurs when weights and activations are quantized to lower bit depths, typically 8 bits or less.\n",

    "During the training process, the weights and activations of the model are quantized to a lower bit depth, typically 8 bits.

This approach is typically used when the size of the model exceeds the available memory on a single device or node. Model parallelism can be challenging to implement, as it requires careful coordination between the different parts of the model and can lead to communication overhead between devices.\n",

    "In data parallelism, the training data is split across multiple devices or nodes, and each device or node trains a copy of the full model using a subset of the training data.

This approach is generally easier to implement than model parallelism and can be more efficient, as there is less communication overhead between devices.\n",

Additionally, many machine learning frameworks provide built-in support for data parallelism, which makes it easier to take advantage of distributed training across multiple devices or nodes.

It is generally used for asynchronous training and is suitable for very large models with a lot of parameters.\n",
