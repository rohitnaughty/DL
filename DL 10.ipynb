However, if you are working with simple request/response APIs or need to support a wide range of clients, REST APIs may be a better choice."

This technique involves training a model to be resilient to the loss of precision that occurs when weights and activations are quantized to lower bit depths, typically 8 bits or less.\n",

    "During the training process, the weights and activations of the model are quantized to a lower bit depth, typically 8 bits.

This approach is typically used when the size of the model exceeds the available memory on a single device or node. Model parallelism can be challenging to implement, as it requires careful coordination between the different parts of the model and can lead to communication overhead between devices.\n",

    "In data parallelism, the training data is split across multiple devices or nodes, and each device or node trains a copy of the full model using a subset of the training data. The gradients computed by each copy of the model are then aggregated, and the weights of the model are updated accordingly. This approach is generally easier to implement than model parallelism and can be more efficient, as there is less communication overhead between devices.\n",

Additionally, many machine learning frameworks provide built-in support for data parallelism, which makes it easier to take advantage of distributed training across multiple devices or nodes. However, there may be cases where model parallelism is necessary, such as when training very large models that cannot fit into the memory of a single device or node."

The parameter servers apply the gradients to the variables and broadcast the updated variables back to the workers. It is generally used for asynchronous training and is suitable for very large models with a lot of parameters.\n",
