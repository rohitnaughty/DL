    "TensorFlow is not a drop-in replacement for NumPy, as they have different programming paradigms. NumPy is primarily focused on array operations, while TensorFlow is focused on building and running computational graphs for machine learning applications, with support for distributed computing, GPUs, and automatic differentiation. TensorFlow is designed to be highly scalable, making it well-suited for large-scale distributed training of deep learning models. Another key difference is that TensorFlow allows for the use of specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, to speed up computations. While both libraries are widely used in data science and machine learning, they serve different purposes and are best used in different contexts.\n",
