    "If your input pipeline is the bottleneck during training, you may notice some of the following symptoms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The CPU utilization is high, while the GPU utilization is low: This suggests that the CPU is spending a lot of time processing data and feeding it to the GPU, which is not fully utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The GPU utilization fluctuates: This suggests that the GPU is waiting for the CPU to provide it with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The training time per step increases over time: This suggests that the input pipeline is slowing down over time, possibly due to the accumulation of queuing delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The throughput (number of samples processed per second) is lower than expected: This suggests that the input pipeline is not able to feed data to the model as quickly as it should.\n",

    "To fix an input pipeline bottleneck, you can try the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increase the number of preprocessing threads: By increasing the number of preprocessing threads, you can parallelize the data preprocessing pipeline and reduce the amount of time spent waiting for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increase the size of the input pipeline buffer: By increasing the buffer size, you can reduce the likelihood of queuing delays and improve the throughput of the input pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use data prefetching: By using data prefetching, you can overlap the data preprocessing and model training steps and reduce the idle time of the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use distributed training: By using distributed training, you can distribute the workload across multiple machines and increase the processing power of the input pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Optimize the preprocessing code: By optimizing the preprocessing code, you can reduce the amount of time spent on data preprocessing and improve the overall efficiency of the input pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Performance: Serialized protocol buffers are optimized for performance and space efficiency. They can be easily parsed and processed by TensorFlow tools, and they are usually smaller in size than other binary data formats.\n",

    "While it is technically possible to save any binary data to a TFRecord file, it may not be as efficient or convenient as using serialized protocol buffers. In addition, using non-protocol buffer data may require additional parsing and validation steps when reading and processing the data, which can add complexity and reduce performance. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use serialized protocol buffers when working with TFRecord files."

    "When using TFRecords, you may want to activate compression when the dataset is large and storage space is a concern. Compression can significantly reduce the disk space required to store the dataset. Additionally, if the dataset is being transferred over a network, compression can reduce the amount of time required for data transfer.\n",

    "However, there are some trade-offs to consider when using compression. First, compressed data may take longer to read and decompress, which can slow down the training process. Second, compression can make it more difficult to access and modify individual records within the dataset. Finally, compressing data that is already highly compressed, such as image or audio data, may not result in significant space savings.\n",

The decision to activate compression should be made based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the storage and performance requirements of the machine learning system. If storage space is not a concern and the dataset can be loaded quickly enough without compression, then it may be better to skip compression."
